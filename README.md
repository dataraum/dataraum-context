<!-- mcp-name: io.github.dataraum/dataraum -->

A rich metadata context engine for AI-driven data analytics.

Traditional semantic layers tell BI tools "what things are called." DataRaum tells AI "what the data means, how it behaves, how it relates, and what you can compute from it."

The core insight: AI agents don't need tools to discover metadata at runtime. They need **rich, pre-computed context** delivered in a format optimized for LLM consumption.

## Status — transitioning to v1

DataRaum is mid-pivot. v0.2.x exposed a 12-tool MCP server over HTTP for use from Claude Code / Claude Desktop. **That transport is gone.** The v1 plan splits the system into:

- **Python engine + thin FastAPI REST shell** (this repo) — the analysis pipeline and engine primitives over REST
- **[dataraum-cockpit](https://github.com/dataraum/dataraum-cockpit)** — TanStack Start web UI that hosts the chat surface and renders the agentic widgets
- **[dataraum-api](https://github.com/dataraum/dataraum-api)** — OpenAPI contract published by this repo, consumed by the cockpit

Today the substrate boots cleanly and you can poke `/health`; the engine REST routes (`/api/*`) are being extracted from `src/dataraum/mcp/server.py` route-by-route. The cockpit is scaffolded; chat lands in a later step. **There is no working end-user surface yet** — if you need v0.2.x MCP behavior, pin `dataraum==0.2.2`.

## Quick Start (substrate + cockpit — v1 surface in development)

```bash
# Clone both repos as siblings — docker-compose builds the cockpit from
# the sibling path.
git clone https://github.com/dataraum/dataraum
git clone https://github.com/dataraum/dataraum-cockpit
cd dataraum

# Set the LLM key (the engine needs it; the substrate boot does not)
cp .env.example .env
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." >> .env

# Bring up Postgres + control plane + cockpit
docker compose up -d --wait

# Verify the substrate
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/health
# → {"status":"ok","ducklake":{"status":"ok",...},"postgres":{"status":"ok"}}

# Open the cockpit
open http://localhost:3000
```

For UI iteration, skip the cockpit container and run the dev server outside
docker for hot reload (see `dataraum-cockpit/README.md`). The compose
cockpit service is for end-to-end smoke and prod-like serving.

The engine runs an 18-phase analysis pipeline. The 12 tools the v1 cockpit exposes (also the shape the engine REST will publish, route by route):

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `add_source` | Register a data source (CSV, Parquet, JSON, directory, or MSSQL recipe yaml) |
| `list_sources` | List sources registered in the workspace |
| `begin_session` | Start an investigation session bound to one registered source |
| `resume_session` | List archived sessions; restore one and make it active again |
| `look` | Explore data structure, relationships, and semantic metadata |
| `measure` | Measure entropy scores, readiness, and data quality |
| `why` | Explain elevated entropy and propose teach suggestions |
| `teach` | Extend the operation model — sole write tool (concepts, metrics, validations, ...) |
| `query` | Natural language query against the data |
| `run_sql` | Execute SQL directly with export support |
| `search_snippets` | Discover reusable SQL patterns from prior queries and graph execution |
| `end_session` | Archive workspace and end the session |

### Typical Workflow (the shape the v1 cockpit will surface)

```
add_source(name="accounting", path="/var/lib/dataraum/sources/accounting")
  → begin_session(source="accounting",
                  intent="explore data quality",
                  contract="exploratory_analysis")
  → look()                    # Understand the data
  → measure()                 # Check quality scores and readiness
  → query("total revenue?")   # Ask questions
  → run_sql(sql="...", export_format="csv", export_name="report")
  → end_session(outcome="delivered")
```

Each session is bound to **one** registered source. The engine logic that powered these tools in v0.2.x lives in `src/dataraum/mcp/server.py`; the v1 plan extracts it into FastAPI route handlers as the cockpit needs each route.

## What It Produces

DataRaum analyzes your data and generates:

- **Statistical metadata** — distributions, cardinality, null rates, patterns
- **Semantic metadata** — column roles, entity types, business terms (LLM-powered)
- **Topological metadata** — relationships, join paths, hierarchies
- **Temporal metadata** — granularity, gaps, seasonality, trends
- **Quality metadata** — rules, scores, anomalies
- **Entropy scores** — uncertainty quantification across all dimensions
- **Ontological context** — domain-specific interpretation (financial, marketing, etc.)

## LLM Configuration

Semantic analysis requires an Anthropic API key. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your `.env` before `docker compose up`. The container reads it from the compose env.

Configure the LLM provider in `config/llm/config.yaml`. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for details.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dataraum/dataraum
cd dataraum

# Install with dev dependencies (using uv)
uv sync --group dev

# Run tests
uv run pytest --testmon tests/unit -q

# Type check
uv run mypy src/

# Lint
uv run ruff check src/
uv run ruff format --check src/

# Run the control plane locally (without docker)
export DUCKLAKE_CATALOG_URL=postgresql://...
export DUCKLAKE_DATA_PATH=/var/lib/dataraum/lake
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
uv run uvicorn dataraum.server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
