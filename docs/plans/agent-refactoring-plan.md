## Problem Statement

The four LLM agents (business cycles, validation, graph, query) grew independently.
They share infrastructure but diverged in how they load context, reference vertical
configuration, and surface results. Key issues:

1. **Vertical is hardcoded** — Only semantic agent abstracts the vertical name. GraphLoader,
   cycle config, validation config all hardwire `verticals/finance/`.
2. **Context loading is inconsistent** — Each agent builds its own context differently.
   Some load from DB objects, some from raw relationships, some skip data entirely.
3. **Agents don't use the metadata they have** — The pipeline now produces slice definitions,
   statistical profiles, temporal profiles, enriched views, quality grades, and entropy
   interpretations. Neither the cycle nor validation agent uses any of these.
4. **Cycle agent rediscovers what's already known** — Its exploration tools re-query
   data that's already in statistical profiles and slice definitions. The tool loop
   (3-15 LLM round trips) is unnecessary when context is rich enough.
5. **Validation results are a dead end** — Written to DB, never consumed downstream.
6. **Business cycle richness is lost** — Stages, entity flows, health observations
   discarded when loaded into GraphExecutionContext.
7. **Quality metrics conflated with business metrics** — `metrics/quality/` serves the
   entropy layer but lives alongside DSO/current_ratio and is executed by the graph agent.
8. **Graph + Query agents are near-duplicates** — Same SQL generation, execution, repair,
   assumption tracking, library storage. Different input format.

## Key Insight: Tools vs Context

The cycle agent's exploration tools exist because the original context was thin.
Now the pipeline produces rich pre-computed metadata that makes the tools redundant:

| What LLM needs | Old approach (tool calls) | New approach (in context) |
|---|---|---|
| Status column values | `get_column_value_distribution` → SQL | Slice definitions: already identified with LLM confidence |
| Completion rates | `get_cycle_completion_metrics` → 4 SQL queries | Computable from slice counts in context |
| Entity flows | `get_entity_transaction_flow` → SQL | Enriched views: pre-joined tables |
| Value distributions | `get_column_value_distribution` → SQL | Statistical profiles: `top_values` pre-computed |
| Date ranges | *(not available)* | Temporal profiles: min/max, granularity, gaps |
| Data quality | *(not available)* | Quality grades: A/B/C per column with findings |

**Decision: Eliminate exploration tools. The cycle agent becomes a single LLM call
with structured output (like the validation agent already is).**

## Sequencing Principles

- **Rewrite cycle agent, fix validation agent in-place.** Cycle changes are too deep
  for in-place editing (~73% of code replaced/deleted). Validation changes are surgical.
- **Each step = one commit.** If interrupted, codebase is green. Plan file says where to resume.
- **Tests are the checkpoint.** `pytest --testmon tests -q` must pass after every step.
- **Deep dive before coding.** Phase A starts with audit, not changes.
- **_legacy/ as reference.** Old cycle agent files moved to `_legacy/` during rewrite,
  deleted once tests pass.

---

## Phase A: Fix + Modernize Agent Context

**Goal:** Both agents load the right context from the right sources. Cycle agent
rewritten as single-call synthesis. Validation agent fixed in-place.

### A0. Audit & Document Current State ✅

> **Completed 2026-02-24.** See A0 Findings below.
> Deep evaluation of agent approaches vs available metadata also completed.

### A1. Rewrite Business Cycle Agent (context → synthesis)

**Strategy:** Move `context.py`, `agent.py`, `tools.py` to `analysis/cycles/_legacy/`.
Rewrite from scratch using pre-computed pipeline metadata. Keep `config.py`,
`models.py`, `db_models.py` unchanged. Delete `_legacy/` when tests pass.

#### A1a. New context builder (`context.py`)

Rewrite `build_cycle_detection_context()` to load from all available metadata:

| Data Source | DB Model / Table | What it provides | Example from test data |
|---|---|---|---|
| Slice definitions | `SliceDefinition` | Pre-identified status columns with values + counts | `invoices.status`: paid, open, cancelled, overdue, partial (conf 0.95) |
| Statistical profiles | `StatisticalProfile` | Top values, null rates, distinct counts, distributions | `bank_transactions.counterparty`: 28 distinct, top = "GlobalTech" (12.5%) |
| Temporal profiles | `TemporalColumnProfile` | Date ranges, granularity, gaps, staleness | `invoices.date`: 2025-01-01 to 2025-12-28, irregular, 1.0 completeness |
| Quality reports | `ColumnQualityReport` | Quality grades (A/B/C), key findings, anomalies | `journal_lines.credit`: grade C, Benford violation in CC400 |
| Enriched views | `EnrichedView` + DuckDB `enriched_*` | Pre-joined table schemas | `enriched_invoices`: invoices + payments columns |
| Semantic annotations | `SemanticAnnotation` | business_concept, semantic_role, entity_type | `invoices.amount` → concept=accounts_payable, role=measure |
| Entity classifications | `TableEntity` | Fact vs dimension, grain columns | `invoices`: fact table, grain=invoice_id |
| Relationships | `Relationship` (detection_method="llm" only) | Confirmed FK/hierarchy relationships | `payments.invoice_id → invoices.invoice_id` (FK, conf 0.95) |
| Graph topology | computed from relationships | Hub tables, star/snowflake patterns | chart_of_accounts is hub (3 incoming FKs) |
| Domain vocabulary | `config/verticals/{vertical}/cycles.yaml` | Cycle type definitions, completion indicators | order_to_cash, procure_to_pay definitions |

New `format_context_for_prompt()` organizes this as:
1. Domain vocabulary (reference framework)
2. Dataset summary (tables, facts/dimensions, row counts)
3. Pre-identified cycle indicators (slice definitions = status columns)
4. Enriched views (pre-joined tables the LLM can reason about)
5. Relationships (LLM-confirmed only)
6. Temporal patterns (date ranges, granularity per temporal column)
7. Quality signals (grades, anomalies)
8. Column semantics by table (with business_concept)

#### A1b. New agent (`agent.py`)

Rewrite `BusinessCycleAgent.analyze()` as single-call structured output:

- **No tool loop.** Single `ConversationRequest` → structured output via `submit_analysis` tool.
- **No `_execute_tool`.** Deleted (no exploration tools).
- **No `_parse_response` fallback.** Single parsing path via `_parse_tool_output`.
- **New system prompt** focused on synthesis: "Here are the pre-identified status columns,
  confirmed relationships, enriched views, and temporal patterns. Synthesize this into
  business cycle analysis."
- **`tools.py` deleted entirely.** Only the `submit_analysis` Pydantic schema stays
  (moved into agent.py or models.py as tool definition).

Files affected:
- `context.py` → rewrite (new data sources)
- `agent.py` → rewrite (single-call, no tool loop)
- `tools.py` → delete (tools eliminated)
- `config.py` → keep (vocabulary loading)
- `models.py` → keep (output models unchanged — `BusinessCycleAnalysisOutput` still used as tool schema)
- `db_models.py` → keep (persistence unchanged)

### A2. Fix Validation Agent (in-place)

**Strategy:** Surgical edits to `resolver.py` and `agent.py`. Structure stays.

#### A2a. Enrich resolver context (`resolver.py`)

1. **Add detection_method filter** — `Relationship.detection_method == "llm"` on line 78-83
2. **Add business_concept + business_description** — to `_format_table_schema` column output (line 126-134)
3. **Add row counts per table** — DuckDB `SELECT COUNT(*)` per table, added to schema dict
4. **Add enriched view schemas** — Query `EnrichedView` table, include available pre-joined views
5. **Update prompt formatter** — `format_multi_table_schema_for_prompt` includes new fields

Tangible change to schema XML:
```xml
<!-- Before -->
<column name="amount" type="DECIMAL" role="measure" entity="transaction_amount" business_name="Amount" />

<!-- After -->
<column name="amount" type="DECIMAL" role="measure" entity="transaction_amount"
        business_name="Amount" business_concept="accounts_payable"
        description="Total invoice amount in local currency" />
```

#### A2b. Fix agent execution (`agent.py`)

1. **Replace pandas `.df()`** — Use `duckdb_conn.execute(...).fetchall()` + `result.description` (line 297-298)
2. **Add EXPLAIN validation** — Before SQL execution, run `EXPLAIN {sql}` to catch syntax errors (line 296)
3. **Fix balance evaluation** — Require specific output columns (`total_debits`, `total_credits`, `difference`);
   fail explicitly when columns missing instead of defaulting to pass (line 492-514)
4. **Update prompt for column naming** — Add instruction: "Your output query MUST include columns named
   `total_debits`, `total_credits`, and `difference` for balance checks"

---

## Phase B: Clean the Model

**Goal:** Vertical config becomes a proper abstraction. Quality metrics move to where they belong.

### B1. Create VerticalConfig Abstraction

- New class `VerticalConfig` that bundles: ontology, cycles, filters, metrics, validations
- Single entry point: `VerticalConfig.load("finance")` loads everything
- Replace hardcoded paths in:
  - `GraphLoader.__init__()` (currently `get_config_dir("verticals/finance")`)
  - `analysis/cycles/config.py` (currently `get_config_dir("verticals/finance/cycles.yaml")`)
  - `analysis/validation/config.py` (currently `verticals/finance/validations/`)
- Vertical name flows from pipeline config → phase config → agent
- Semantic agent already works this way (OntologyLoader) — extend the pattern

### B2. Extract Quality Metrics from metrics/ to Entropy System

- Move `config/verticals/finance/metrics/quality/*.yaml` to `config/entropy/quality_metrics/`
- These become inputs to entropy dimension scoring, not graph-executed metrics
- GraphLoader stops loading them as metric graphs
- Entropy processor consumes them directly (or they inform detector thresholds)
- Adjust any tests that reference quality metrics as graph metrics

---

## Phase C: Complete the Context

**Goal:** All agent outputs flow into GraphExecutionContext for downstream use.

### C1. Surface Validation Results in GraphExecutionContext

- Add `ValidationContext` dataclass to `graphs/context.py`
- Load from `ValidationResultRecord` in `build_execution_context()`
- Include: check name, status, severity, message (not full SQL)
- Query agent and graph agent now know about accounting rule failures
- Entropy layer can factor in validation failures as a signal

### C2. Forward Full Cycle Data to Context

- Replace flat `BusinessCycleContext` (4 fields) with richer structure
- Include: stages with completion rates, entity flows, health observations
- Query agent can now reason about business process state
- Format for prompt: concise business process summary, not raw data

### C3. Align Ontology Concepts with Graph standard_field Vocabulary

- Audit: compare ontology concept names vs graph `standard_field` references
- Options: (a) unify naming, (b) add mapping layer, (c) validate at load time
- Decision during implementation based on divergence found
- Goal: no silent mapping failures

---

## Phase D: Merge Graph + Query Agents

**Goal:** Single `DataAgent` with two entry points: `execute_graph()` and `answer_question()`.

### D1. Consolidate Shared Infrastructure

- Unify context building (both already use `build_execution_context`)
- Unify SQL generation prompts (both use tool-use pattern)
- Unify execution (both use `execute_sql_steps` from `query/execution.py`)
- Unify assumption tracking (both produce `QueryAssumption`)
- Unify repair logic (both have `_repair_sql`)
- Unify library storage (both save to `QueryLibrary`)

### D2. Create DataAgent

- Single agent class with:
  - `execute_graph(graph_spec, context)` — deterministic metric calculation
  - `answer_question(question, context)` — ad-hoc natural language query
- Graph execution phase calls `execute_graph()`
- MCP `query` tool calls `answer_question()`
- Shared: context building, SQL generation, execution, assumptions, library

### D3. Clean Up Old Modules

- Remove `graphs/agent.py` and `query/agent.py` after merge
- Update all imports
- Update pipeline phases and MCP server
- Verify all tests pass with new structure

## A0 Findings

> Audit completed 2026-02-24. Each section documents what the agent loads,
> what's wrong, and what to fix.

### Business Cycle Agent

**Files:** `analysis/cycles/context.py`, `agent.py`, `tools.py`, `config.py`

#### What it loads (context.py `build_cycle_detection_context`)

1. **Tables + columns** — from `Table`, `Column` DB objects. ✅ Correct.
2. **Semantic annotations** — from `SemanticAnnotation` DB objects, joined via Column/Table. ✅ Correct.
3. **Status column detection** — scans `entity_type` for keywords ("status", "state", "paid", "cleared", "flag"), then queries DuckDB for distinct values. ⚠ Fragile (see issues).
4. **Entity classifications** — from `TableEntity` DB objects. ✅ Correct.
5. **Relationships** — from `Relationship` DB objects, but with N+1 query problem. ⚠ See issues.
6. **Graph topology** — calls `analyze_graph_topology()` with the relationship dicts. ✅ Correct pattern.
7. **Domain vocabulary** — from `config/verticals/finance/cycles.yaml`. ✅ Correct (but hardcoded vertical).

#### Issues Found

**Issue 1: Relationship loading has N+1 query pattern (context.py:177-211)**
The code loads relationships by `from_table_id`, then for each relationship does **two separate queries** to get `to_table_name` and `to_column_name`:
```python
to_table_stmt = select(Table.table_name).where(Table.table_id == rel.to_table_id)
to_col_stmt = select(Column.column_name).where(Column.column_id == rel.to_column_id)
```
With 20 relationships, that's 40 extra queries. Compare with `graphs/context.py:301-339` which loads all relationships in one query and resolves names from the already-loaded column/table lists.

**Fix:** Load relationships with both `from_table_id` and `to_table_id` in the table_ids set (like `graphs/context.py` does), resolve names from already-loaded Table/Column objects. Remove the inner-loop queries.

**Issue 2: Relationships not filtered by detection_method (context.py:199)**
The code uses a confidence threshold (`rel.confidence > 0.7`) OR `detection_method == "llm"` as filter. Compare with `graphs/context.py:305` which filters strictly to `detection_method == "llm"`. The cycle agent may include low-confidence `candidate` relationships that haven't been LLM-confirmed, polluting the context with noise.

**Fix:** Filter to `detection_method == "llm"` only, matching `graphs/context.py` behavior.

**Issue 3: Status column detection is purely heuristic (context.py:123-126)**
Status columns are detected by checking if `entity_type` contains keywords like "status", "state", "paid". This misses columns where the semantic agent classified `entity_type` differently (e.g., "transaction_status" might match, but "payment_indicator" won't). The semantic agent already has `semantic_role` — a column with role "status" or entity_type containing status-like terms should both qualify.

**Fix:** Also check `semantic_role` for status-like values, and check `business_description` for status keywords. Or better: have the semantic agent explicitly tag status columns during its analysis (deferred to Phase B when vertical config is abstracted).

**Issue 4: Column `resolved_type` may be None (context.py:88)**
The context builder uses `c.resolved_type` which can be None for columns that haven't been through type resolution. The prompt receives `null` type info for these columns.

**Fix:** Fall back to `c.raw_type` when `resolved_type` is None (like the validation resolver does at `resolver.py:124`).

**Issue 5: Duplicate code in agent.py `_parse_tool_output` vs `_parse_response` (agent.py:370-604)**
Both methods contain ~100 lines of nearly identical cycle parsing code (EntityFlow construction, stage parsing, vocabulary mapping, analysis assembly). The `_parse_response` is a JSON fallback that's rarely used.

**Fix (streamlining):** Extract shared cycle parsing into a helper. Consider removing the JSON fallback entirely — if the LLM doesn't call `submit_analysis`, that's a prompt/model issue, not something to silently handle with fragile JSON extraction.

**Issue 6: Config hardcoded to finance (config.py:33)**
`get_config_file("verticals/finance/cycles.yaml")` — will break for any non-finance vertical.

**Fix:** Deferred to Phase B1 (VerticalConfig abstraction).

#### What the Prompt Expects vs What It Gets

The system prompt tells the LLM to look for:
- Entity flows (dimension → fact relationships) ← **Gets this** from entity classifications + relationships
- Status columns with distinct values ← **Gets this** but detection is fragile (Issue 3)
- Transaction type columns ← **Does NOT get these explicitly**; relies on LLM inferring from semantic annotations
- Relationships to follow ← **Gets this** but may include noisy candidates (Issue 2)

#### Summary: A1 Fix List

| # | Fix | Scope | Risk |
|---|-----|-------|------|
| 1 | Remove N+1 relationship queries, use pre-loaded data | context.py:177-211 | Low |
| 2 | Filter relationships to `detection_method == "llm"` | context.py:199 | Low |
| 3 | Improve status column detection (add semantic_role check) | context.py:122-126 | Low |
| 4 | Fall back to `raw_type` when `resolved_type` is None | context.py:88 | Low |
| 5 | Extract shared cycle parsing, remove JSON fallback | agent.py | Medium |
| 6 | Hardcoded finance config | Deferred to B1 | — |

---

### Validation Agent

**Files:** `analysis/validation/resolver.py`, `agent.py`, `config.py`

#### What it loads (resolver.py `get_multi_table_schema_for_llm`)

1. **Tables with columns** — Eager-loads via `selectinload(Table.columns).selectinload(Column.semantic_annotation)`. ✅ Clean, single query with joins.
2. **Semantic annotations** — Loaded alongside columns via eager loading. ✅ Correct.
3. **Relationships** — from `Relationship` DB objects filtered by `from_table_id` and `to_table_id` both in table_ids. ✅ Correct pattern.
4. **Column name/type info** — Uses `resolved_type or raw_type` fallback. ✅ Correct.

#### Issues Found

**Issue 1: No detection_method filter on relationships (resolver.py:78-83)**
Unlike `graphs/context.py` which filters to `detection_method == "llm"`, the validation resolver loads ALL relationships between the tables. This includes raw `candidate` relationships from join detection that haven't been LLM-confirmed. For validation SQL generation (e.g., trial balance requiring joins), noisy join candidates could lead the LLM to generate incorrect JOINs.

**Fix:** Add `Relationship.detection_method == "llm"` filter to match the standard.

**Issue 2: No business_concept in schema (resolver.py:126-134)**
The resolver passes `semantic_role`, `entity_type`, and `business_name` to the LLM. It does NOT pass `business_concept` (e.g., "revenue", "accounts_receivable") or `business_description`. For financial validations like trial_balance (Assets = Liabilities + Equity), the LLM needs to know which columns represent assets vs liabilities. Without `business_concept`, it relies on name matching.

**Fix:** Add `business_concept` and `business_description` to the column schema passed to the prompt.

**Issue 3: No statistical context (agent.py)**
The validation agent receives only schema information (column names, types, semantic roles). It gets no statistical context: null ratios, row counts, value distributions. For validations like `fiscal_period_integrity` (checking for gaps), knowing the date range or row count per period would help the LLM generate better SQL.

**Fix (lightweight):** Add row counts per table to the schema dict. Full statistical context would be over-engineering for the validation use case.

**Issue 4: Validation results use pandas `.df()` (agent.py:297-298)**
```python
result_df = duckdb_conn.execute(generated.sql_query).df()
result_rows = result_df.to_dict(orient="records")
```
This pulls results through pandas, which is unnecessary. DuckDB can return tuples directly. This creates an unnecessary pandas dependency for the validation path.

**Fix:** Use `duckdb_conn.execute(...).fetchall()` with `result.description` for column names, matching the pattern in `query/execution.py`.

**Issue 5: No SQL validation before execution (agent.py:296)**
The graph agent validates generated SQL with `EXPLAIN` before execution (`graphs/agent.py` `_validate_sql`). The validation agent executes LLM-generated SQL directly without syntax checking. A malformed query hits DuckDB cold.

**Fix:** Add `EXPLAIN` validation before execution, or wrap in try/except with a repair attempt (like the graph agent does). For now, the try/except at line 324 catches failures but doesn't attempt repair.

**Issue 6: Config hardcoded to finance (config.py)**
`load_all_validation_specs()` loads from `config/verticals/finance/validations/`. Same issue as cycles.

**Fix:** Deferred to Phase B1 (VerticalConfig abstraction).

**Issue 7: `_evaluate_result` is brittle for balance checks (agent.py:492-512)**
The balance evaluation searches for columns containing "total" or "sum" in their name. If the LLM names columns differently (e.g., "debit_balance", "credit_balance"), the check silently falls through to "Balance check passed" (line 514) — a false positive.

**Fix:** The prompt should instruct the LLM to use specific column names (`total_debits`, `total_credits`, `difference`), and the evaluation should fail explicitly when it can't find expected columns rather than defaulting to pass.

#### What the Prompt Expects vs What It Gets

The prompt template (`config/llm/prompts/validation_sql.yaml`) receives:
- `spec_name`, `spec_description`, `check_type` ← From YAML spec. ✅
- `parameters` (tolerance, account types, etc.) ← From YAML spec. ✅
- `sql_hints` ← From YAML spec. ✅ Good — gives the LLM concrete guidance
- `schema` (XML formatted tables + columns + relationships) ← From resolver. ⚠ Missing `business_concept`
- `expected_outcome` ← From YAML spec. ✅

The schema XML shows column names, types, semantic roles, entity types, business names, and relationships. For financial validations, the missing piece is `business_concept` — the ontology-level classification that maps columns to accounting categories.

#### Summary: A2 Fix List

| # | Fix | Scope | Risk |
|---|-----|-------|------|
| 1 | Filter relationships to `detection_method == "llm"` | resolver.py:78-83 | Low |
| 2 | Add `business_concept` + `business_description` to schema | resolver.py:126-134 | Low |
| 3 | Add row counts per table to schema | resolver.py | Low |
| 4 | Replace pandas `.df()` with DuckDB `.fetchall()` | agent.py:297-298 | Low |
| 5 | Add EXPLAIN validation before SQL execution | agent.py:296 | Low |
| 6 | Hardcoded finance config | Deferred to B1 | — |
| 7 | Make balance evaluation fail explicitly on missing columns | agent.py:492-514 | Medium |

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-24 | Fix context loading before architecture | Broken context makes all later changes unreliable |
| 2026-02-24 | Quality metrics → entropy, not graph metrics | They measure data health, not business KPIs |
| 2026-02-24 | Merge graph + query into DataAgent | 80% shared code, same execution pattern |
| 2026-02-24 | Phase A starts with audit (A0) | Deep dive prevents wasted effort on wrong fixes |
| 2026-02-24 | Eliminate cycle agent tools, use context only | Pipeline now produces slice defs, statistical profiles, temporal profiles, enriched views — all the data the tools re-queried. Single LLM call with rich context replaces 3-15 tool call loop |
| 2026-02-24 | Rewrite cycle agent (move to _legacy/) | ~73% of code replaced/deleted (context.py, agent.py, tools.py). In-place editing would leave dead code. Move to _legacy/, rewrite from scratch, delete when tests pass |
| 2026-02-24 | Fix validation agent in-place | Changes are surgical (~30% of code touched). Structure is sound, just needs enriched context and execution fixes |
