# Query Agent Architecture: RAG-Based Query Reuse

## Core Insight

**Reusing validated queries stabilizes entropy faster than generating fresh SQL.**

Traditional approaches have the LLM generate SQL from scratch for each question. This means:
- Every query is "novel" from an entropy perspective
- No learning accumulates across sessions
- Same mistakes get repeated
- Users don't trust results

The DataRaum approach inverts this:
- Build a library of **validated query patterns**
- Search by semantic similarity when users ask questions
- Adapt existing patterns rather than generating from scratch
- Only generate new SQL for genuinely novel patterns
- Validated queries have **known entropy profiles**

### Why This Works

| Approach | Entropy Behavior |
|----------|------------------|
| **Generate CTEs each time** | Every query is novel → entropy stays high, no learning |
| **RAG of tested queries** | Reuse validated patterns → entropy drops with each use |

The flywheel effect:
1. More queries in library → better retrieval
2. Better retrieval → more reuse
3. More reuse → queries get validated/refined
4. Refined queries → lower entropy profiles
5. Lower entropy → higher user trust → more usage

---

## Query Library Schema

Each query entry contains:

```yaml
query_id: "revenue_by_region_monthly"
version: 3

# Semantic metadata for RAG retrieval
description: "Monthly revenue breakdown by sales region"
business_context:
  metric: "revenue"
  dimensions: ["region", "month"]
  filters: ["active_customers_only"]
  industry: "finance"

# The actual SQL
sql: |
  SELECT
    region,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
    SUM(amount) as revenue
  FROM typed_orders
  WHERE customer_status = 'active'
  GROUP BY 1, 2

# Lineage (which tables/columns touched)
dependencies:
  tables: ["typed_orders"]
  columns: ["region", "order_date", "amount", "customer_status"]

# Validated entropy profile
entropy_profile:
  currency: 0.2      # validated: all EUR
  temporal: 0.1      # validated: calendar months
  null_handling: 0.3 # some nulls in region, documented
  overall: 0.2

# Assumptions baked into this query
assumptions:
  - basis: "system_default"
    description: "Revenue in EUR"
  - basis: "inferred"
    description: "Excluding cancelled orders"

# Usage tracking
validated_at: "2026-01-15"
validated_by: "analyst@company.com"
usage_count: 47
last_used: "2026-01-22"

# For graph visualization
calculation_graph:
  - step: "filter"
    description: "Active customers only"
  - step: "aggregate"
    description: "Sum amount by region and month"
```

---

## The Graph View's Dual Purpose

The web_visualizer prototype shows calculation graphs: how metrics are built from the typed data layer through aggregations to final metrics.

**Purpose 1: Human Understanding**
- Visualize data lineage
- Understand how metrics are calculated
- See which columns contribute to which outputs
- Drill down into calculation steps

**Purpose 2: Query Library Seeding**
- Each graph IS a validated SQL pattern
- Graphs come with semantic tags (metric name, dimensions, business context)
- The visualization provides the "documentation" users need to trust the query
- Expand/collapse reveals calculation breakdown

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    MetricNode                           │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │  Monthly Revenue by Region                       │   │
│  │  €12.1M                                         │   │

│  │  ▼ Expand calculation                           │   │
│  │    ├─ SUM(amount) from typed_orders            │   │
│  │    ├─ Filtered: customer_status = 'active'     │   │
│  │    ├─ Grouped: region, month                   │   │
│  │    └─ Entropy: 0.2 (ready)                     │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Existing Modules and Adaptation Needed

### `graphs/` Module (Current State)

The existing graphs module was designed for:
- Pre-defined calculation graphs based on industry-standard metrics
- Financial metrics (revenue, costs, margins, etc.)
- Graph execution with filter application
- Entropy-aware query behavior

**Adaptation needed:**
- Add semantic embeddings for RAG retrieval
- Store validated entropy profiles per graph
- Track usage and validation history
- Support graph composition (combining building blocks)

### `web_visualizer` Prototype (Current State)

Shows:
- MetricNode, FieldNode, AccountNode, TransactionNode
- Expand/collapse for calculation breakdown
- Drill-down modals with sortable tables
- Sidebar navigation between views

**Adaptation needed:**
- Connect to live API (currently uses mock data)
- Add entropy indicators to nodes
- Enable "save as query" workflow
- Support query refinement UI

### `analytics-agents-ts` Prompts (Current State)

Contains sophisticated prompt patterns for:
- SQL generation with DuckDB standards
- Multiple table outputs (executive, analyst, operational)
- Chart type recommendations
- Data quality consideration

**Adaptation needed:**
- Integrate with query library search
- Add "adapt existing query" mode
- Include entropy context in prompts
- Support iterative refinement workflow

---

## Query Agent Workflow

### Step 1: Question Understanding

User asks: "What was our revenue by region last quarter?"

Agent extracts:
- **Metric**: revenue
- **Dimensions**: region
- **Time filter**: last quarter
- **Implicit**: probably wants comparison, totals

### Step 2: Library Search

Search query library with:
```
metric:revenue dimensions:region temporal:quarterly
```

Results:
1. `revenue_by_region_monthly` (0.92 similarity) - adapt time grouping
2. `revenue_by_region_ytd` (0.85 similarity) - different time scope
3. `revenue_total_quarterly` (0.78 similarity) - missing region dimension

### Step 3: Adaptation or Generation

**If good match found:**
```sql
-- Adapted from: revenue_by_region_monthly (v3)
-- Change: DATE_TRUNC('quarter', ...) instead of 'month'
-- Entropy profile: inherited (0.2)
SELECT
  region,
  DATE_TRUNC('quarter', order_date) as quarter,
  SUM(amount) as revenue
FROM typed_orders
WHERE customer_status = 'active'
  AND order_date >= DATE_TRUNC('quarter', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 months')
GROUP BY 1, 2
```

**If no match (novel pattern):**
Generate with full entropy awareness, flag for validation.

### Step 4: Execution with Entropy Context

Execute query and include:
- Assumptions made (inherited from base query + new ones)
- Entropy warnings if any dimensions are uncertain
- Confidence level based on entropy profile

### Step 5: Result Presentation

Following analytics-agents-ts patterns:
- Multiple table views (executive summary, detailed breakdown)
- Chart recommendations based on data shape
- Assumptions clearly stated
- Option to save as new query or update existing

### Step 6: Feedback Loop

User can:
- **Validate**: "This is correct" → increases confidence
- **Refine**: "Actually, exclude APAC" → creates variant
- **Report issue**: "Numbers don't match" → flags for review
- **Save**: Add to library with description

---

## End-to-End Validation Questions

Before building elaborate UI, validate these assumptions:

1. **Can semantic search find relevant queries?**
   - Test: Embed 50 sample queries, search with natural language
   - Success: >80% of questions find relevant match in top 3

2. **Does query reuse actually stabilize entropy?**
   - Test: Track entropy scores over time for reused vs. novel queries
   - Success: Reused queries show lower variance in results

3. **Can users understand the graph view?**
   - Test: Show calculation graph, ask users to explain what it does
   - Success: Users can correctly describe the calculation

4. **Does the RAG approach feel faster/better to users?**
   - Test: A/B test RAG vs. pure generation
   - Success: RAG queries have higher user satisfaction

## Contract-Based Confidence Levels

### The Traffic Light Model

When a user queries with a contract, the response includes a **confidence level** based on how well the data meets the contract's entropy thresholds:

| Level | Color | Meaning | Agent Behavior |
|-------|-------|---------|----------------|
| 🟢 **GREEN** | Green | All thresholds pass | Answer confidently |
| 🟡 **YELLOW** | Yellow | Minor issues (within 20% of threshold) | Answer with minor caveats |
| 🟠 **ORANGE** | Orange | Significant issues (some dimensions exceed) | Answer with strong caveats, list issues |
| 🔴 **RED** | Red | Critical issues (blocking violations) | Refuse or require confirmation |

### Confidence Calculation

```python
def calculate_confidence_level(
    evaluation: ContractEvaluation,
) -> ConfidenceLevel:
    """Calculate traffic light confidence from contract evaluation."""

    if evaluation.is_compliant:
        # Check if any dimensions are close to threshold (within 20%)
        near_threshold = [
            v for v in evaluation.warnings
            if v.actual > v.max_allowed * 0.8
        ]
        if near_threshold:
            return ConfidenceLevel.YELLOW
        return ConfidenceLevel.GREEN

    # Non-compliant: check severity
    blocking = evaluation.get_blocking_violations()

    if blocking:
        # Has blocking violations
        if any(v.severity == "critical" for v in blocking):
            return ConfidenceLevel.RED
        return ConfidenceLevel.ORANGE

    # Non-blocking violations only
    return ConfidenceLevel.YELLOW
```

### Response Format with Confidence

```
🟢 Data Quality: GOOD for executive_dashboard

Revenue by region for Q3 2024:
| Region   | Revenue |
|----------|---------|
| EMEA     | €4.2M   |
| APAC     | €2.8M   |
| Americas | €5.1M   |

Total: €12.1M
```

```
🟠 Data Quality: ISSUES for executive_dashboard

Revenue by region for Q3 2024:
| Region   | Revenue |
|----------|---------|
| EMEA     | €4.2M   |
| APAC     | €2.8M   |
| Americas | €5.1M   |

Total: €12.1M

⚠️ Quality Issues:
- Currency: 45% uncertain (threshold: 20%) — assuming EUR
- Temporal: 35% uncertain (threshold: 30%) — assuming calendar quarter

To improve: Add currency field to orders table, or configure default currency.
```

```
🔴 Data Quality: BLOCKED for regulatory_reporting

I cannot provide a reliable answer for regulatory_reporting because:

❌ Currency entropy: 0.72 (max allowed: 0.10)
   - 40% of revenue records have no currency indicator

❌ Temporal alignment: 0.55 (max allowed: 0.10)
   - Mixed calendar/fiscal periods detected

To proceed:
1. Choose a different contract (e.g., exploratory_analysis)
2. Or resolve these issues first

Would you like me to answer with exploratory_analysis contract instead?
```

### Contract Selection in Queries

Users can specify a contract explicitly or let the system choose a default:

```bash
# Explicit contract
dataraum query "What was revenue?" --contract regulatory_reporting

# Default contract (exploratory_analysis)
dataraum query "What was revenue?"

# Ask system to recommend appropriate contract
dataraum query "What was revenue?" --auto-contract
```

With `--auto-contract`, the system evaluates all contracts and recommends the strictest one that passes:

```
📊 Contract Recommendation:

Your data quality supports:
  🟢 exploratory_analysis — PASS
  🟢 operational_analytics — PASS
  🟡 executive_dashboard — MARGINAL (1 warning)
  🔴 regulatory_reporting — FAIL (3 blocking issues)

Using: executive_dashboard (strictest passing contract)

[Answer follows...]
```

## Architecture: Library-First Design

### Core Principle

The query agent is implemented as a **library function** that both CLI and API call directly. This ensures:
- Single code path for all interfaces
- Faster iteration (no server restart)
- Easier testing and debugging
