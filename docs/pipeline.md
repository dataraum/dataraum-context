# Pipeline

The DataRaum pipeline extracts metadata from CSV and Parquet files through 20 phases (21 exist, 1 de-configured by default). Each phase produces structured metadata stored in SQLite (metadata) and DuckDB (data). Phases declare their dependencies and execute in topological order with parallel execution where possible.

## Running the Pipeline

```bash
# Full pipeline on a directory of CSV files
dataraum run /path/to/data

# Single file with custom output directory
dataraum run /path/to/file.csv --output ./my_output

# Run up to a specific phase (includes dependencies)
dataraum run /path/to/data --phase statistics

# Run with a target contract (fail on violations)
dataraum run /path/to/data --gate-mode fail --contract aggregation_safe
```

Via MCP (Claude Code, Claude Desktop):
```
> Analyze the CSV at /path/to/data.csv
```

Via Python:
```python
from dataraum import Context

# Pipeline runs via CLI or MCP; Context reads the results
ctx = Context("./pipeline_output")
```

## Phase Categories

### Data Layer (Phases 1–2)
**Import** loads CSV/Parquet files as VARCHAR columns into DuckDB (`raw_{table}`). **Typing** infers column types via pattern matching and cast testing, producing `typed_{table}` and `quarantine_{table}` for rows that fail type conversion.

### Profiling Layer (Phases 3–8)
Statistical profiling, temporal analysis, correlation detection, relationship discovery, and quality checks. These phases are purely computational — no LLM calls.

### Enrichment Layer (Phases 9–14)
LLM-powered semantic analysis assigns business meaning to columns. Enriched views join fact and dimension tables. Slicing identifies meaningful data segments for deeper analysis.

### Quality Layer (Phases 15–17)
Quality summaries synthesize per-table reports. Entropy detection measures uncertainty across structural, semantic, value, and computational dimensions. LLM interpretation provides human-readable explanations.

### Domain Layer (Phases 18–20)
Business cycle detection finds multi-table processes (e.g., order-to-cash). Validation runs domain-specific checks (e.g., debits = credits). Graph execution computes configured metrics.

## Entropy Gates

Gates are checkpoints between pipeline phases where **entropy preconditions** are verified. When a phase's preconditions are not met (entropy is too high), the gate fires and the pipeline's behavior depends on the `--gate-mode`:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `skip` (default) | Log warning, continue anyway |
| `fail` | Treat as pipeline failure |

Gates use **detector scores** — machine-verifiable metrics that can objectively gate the pipeline. All detectors calculate metrics from pre-computed metadata and can be used at gates.

Interactive resolution of entropy issues happens **after** the pipeline completes, via `dataraum fix`, not during the pipeline run. This ensures full context (including LLM interpretation) is available for meaningful user interaction.

### Post-Verification

After each phase completes, the orchestrator runs **post-verification** — re-measuring detector scores for dimensions that the phase's output affects. For example:

- After `typing`: measures `type_fidelity`
- After `statistics`: measures `null_ratio`, `outlier_rate`
- After `relationships`: measures `join_path_determinism`, `relationship_quality`
- After `semantic`: measures `naming_clarity`, `unit_declaration`

This populates the `PipelineEntropyState` so that subsequent gates can fire on the first pipeline run (without requiring a prior entropy phase to have run).

## Output Files

The pipeline writes to the output directory (default: `./pipeline_output`):

| File | Engine | Contents |
|------|--------|----------|
| `metadata.db` | SQLite | All metadata: sources, tables, columns, relationships, semantic annotations, quality reports, entropy scores, etc. |
| `data.duckdb` | DuckDB | Raw, typed, and quarantine data tables plus enriched views |

## Checking Pipeline Status

```bash
# Interactive dashboard with phase history, tables, entropy
dataraum tui ./pipeline_output
```

## Rerunning Phases

Phases are idempotent. Rerunning the pipeline skips already-completed phases unless source data has changed.

```bash
# Force re-run of a specific phase
dataraum run /path/to/data --phase statistics --force
```

To start completely fresh, delete the output directory and re-run.
