## Session Log

### 2025-01-07 (Session 2)

**Focus:** Staff engineer review and plan refinement

**Review Findings:**
Identified 21 gaps in the original entropy implementation plan:

1. **Critical Schema Gaps (4):**
   - EntropyObject schema missing fields from spec (effort, expected_entropy_reduction)
   - llm_context and human_context as dict instead of structured
   - No best_guess or assumption_confidence in llm_context
   - ResolutionOption missing cascade tracking

2. **Missing Spec Features (6):**
   - No compound risk detection for dangerous dimension combinations
   - No resolution cascade modeling
   - No data readiness contracts
   - No query-time behavior policies
   - Source.Lifecycle.freshness already implemented but not acknowledged
   - Temporal accumulation_type mostly implemented

3. **Underspecified Items (6):**
   - Topology module simplification criteria unclear
   - LLM prompt extension not designed
   - Category variant detection algorithm missing
   - Null representation wiring gap (data exists in config)
   - Aggregation rules metadata location undefined
   - Test strategy insufficient

4. **Document Structure Issues (3):**
   - Phase numbering inconsistent with spec
   - Cleanup phase timing risk (file moves after integration)
   - Success criteria are counts not quality measures

5. **Missing Entirely (3):**
   - Feedback loop infrastructure
   - Conflict resolution for semantic definitions
   - MCP resource URIs

**Actions Taken:**
1. Rewrote ENTROPY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with:
   - Clear design goal: end-to-end testability with static data
   - Source entropy and entropy history explicitly deferred
   - Compound risk detection (Part 5)
   - Resolution cascade tracking (Part 6)
   - Reordered phases (file migrations in Phase 1.1)
   - Better success criteria with quality measures
   - Document cross-references

2. Created ENTROPY_MODELS.md:
   - Complete EntropyObject schema with all fields
   - ResolutionOption with effort and cascade tracking
   - LLMContext and HumanContext as dataclasses
   - ColumnEntropyProfile and TableEntropyProfile
   - CompoundRisk and CompoundRiskDefinition
   - ResolutionCascade model
   - EntropyContext for graph agent
   - SQLAlchemy db_models
   - Evidence schema examples

3. Created ENTROPY_CONTRACTS.md:
   - 5 standard contract profiles (regulatory, executive, operational, ad-hoc, ML)
   - Dimension-specific thresholds per contract
   - Blocking conditions
   - Contract evaluation algorithm
   - Configuration file format
   - API integration specification
   - UI integration guidance

4. Created ENTROPY_QUERY_BEHAVIOR.md:
   - Entropy level classification (low/medium/high/critical)
   - Behavior decision matrix
   - Response templates for each level
   - Assumption handling and tracking
   - Compound risk behavior
   - Configurable behavior modes (strict/balanced/lenient)
   - SQL generation with entropy comments
   - User feedback loop specification

5. Updated BACKLOG.md:
   - Detailed task breakdown by phase and step
   - Formula specifications for each detector
   - Cross-references to documentation
   - Blocked/waiting items clarified
   - Technical debt section

**Key Decisions:**
- Source entropy deferred (requires infrastructure not yet built)
- Entropy history deferred (too advanced for Phase 1)
- File migrations moved to Phase 1.1 (avoid mid-stream breakage)
- Compound risk detection added to Phase 1.6
- End-to-end testability is primary design goal

**Next Session:**
- Begin Phase 1.1: File migrations
- Move quality/formatting utilities to core/formatting
- Run tests to verify no breakage

### 2025-01-07 (Session 1)

**Focus:** Entropy framework planning

**Completed:**
1. Analyzed entropy-management-framework.md and entropy-framework-future-considerations.md
2. Mapped all existing analysis modules to entropy dimensions
3. Identified gaps in entropy coverage
4. Evaluated modules for keep/remove/merge decisions
5. Created comprehensive implementation plan at docs/ENTROPY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
6. Fixed lint/type errors in temporal_slicing and slicing modules
7. Added session tracking strategy (markdown-based)
8. Incorporated user feedback on:
   - Topology module (graph_topology.py vs TDA topology)
   - Semantic agent extension opportunities
   - Config folder structure
   - Quality formatting utilities
   - UI prototype migration (npm → bun)

**Key Decisions:**
- Use markdown files for session tracking (not GitHub Projects)
- Extend semantic agent for entropy enrichment rather than separate detectors
- Keep quality/formatting base utilities, move to core/
- Simplify TDA topology, keep graph_topology in relationships/
- UI will be migrated to bun in ui/ folder
