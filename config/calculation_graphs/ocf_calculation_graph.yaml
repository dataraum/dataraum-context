# Operating Cash Flow (OCF) Calculation Graph - Indirect Method
# =============================================================================
# 
# Purpose: Calculate cash generated from core business operations
# 
# Formula: Net Income + Non-Cash Items + Working Capital Changes
# 
# The indirect method reconciles net income (accrual basis) to cash flow
# (cash basis) by adjusting for non-cash items and changes in working capital.
# 
# This is the most common method used in financial reporting.

    Start with net income (accrual basis profit)
    Add back: Non-cash expenses (depreciation, amortization)
    Adjust for: Changes in working capital accounts
      - Increase in AR = cash not yet collected (subtract)
      - Decrease in AR = cash collected (add)

      Depreciation and amortization are NON-CASH expenses.
      
      They reduced net income but didn't use cash, so we add them back
      to reconcile to cash flow.

interpretation:
  
  context: |
    Operating Cash Flow (OCF) shows the cash generated by core business operations.
    
    Key insights:
    - OCF > Net Income: Strong cash generation (healthy)
    - OCF < Net Income: Working capital consuming cash (watch carefully)
    - OCF positive, Net Income negative: Cash-basis profitability
    - OCF negative, Net Income positive: Working capital strain (concerning)
    
    The relationship between OCF and Net Income reveals:
    - Quality of earnings (cash vs accrual)
    - Working capital management efficiency
    - Sustainability of business model
    
  healthy_indicators:
    - "OCF consistently positive"
    - "OCF > Net Income (indicates strong cash conversion)"
    - "Working capital changes are modest relative to net income"
    - "OCF covers capital expenditures (Free Cash Flow positive)"
    
  warning_signs:
    - "OCF < Net Income persistently (working capital drain)"
    - "Large negative working capital changes"
    - "OCF negative while reporting profits (non-sustainable)"
    - "High volatility in OCF period-over-period"
    
  actionable_insights:
    strong_ocf:
      - "Consider growth investments"
      - "Evaluate debt reduction opportunities"
      - "May have room to extend customer payment terms"
      
    weak_ocf:
      - "Tighten working capital management"
      - "Accelerate AR collection (reduce DSO)"
      - "Optimize inventory levels (reduce DIO)"
      - "Negotiate better supplier terms (increase DPO)"
      - "Review if revenue growth is sustainable"
