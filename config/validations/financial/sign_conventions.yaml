sql_hints: >
  Look for columns that represent amounts and account types.
  Check semantic annotations for entity_type: amount, account_type.

  Find records where the sign convention is violated:
  - Asset/Expense accounts with negative amounts
  - Liability/Equity/Revenue accounts with unexpected signs

  Return violating rows with: account_identifier (if available), account_type, amount,
  expected_sign, actual_sign.

  Note: Some violations may be valid (contra accounts, adjustments).
  Return all potential violations for review.

expected_outcome: >
  Ideally returns 0 rows (no violations).
  Any returned rows represent potential sign convention violations
  that may need review. A small number of violations may be acceptable
  for contra accounts.
