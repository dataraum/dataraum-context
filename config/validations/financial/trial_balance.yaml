sql_hints: >
  Look for columns that represent amounts and account types/categories.
  Check semantic annotations for entity_type: amount, account_type.

  Group by account_type and sum amounts for each category:
  - Assets: account types containing 'asset'
  - Liabilities: account types containing 'liability'
  - Equity: account types containing 'equity', 'capital'

  Calculate: assets, liabilities, equity, difference = assets - (liabilities + equity)
  Include equation_holds = (ABS(difference) <= tolerance) as boolean.

expected_outcome: >
  Assets should equal Liabilities + Equity within tolerance.
  The equation_holds column should be true for a passing check.
