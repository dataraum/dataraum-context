"""Quality assessment framework (Pillar 5).

The quality module synthesizes quality metrics from all other pillars:
- Statistical quality (Pillar 1)
- Topological quality (Pillar 2)
- Semantic quality (Pillar 3)
- Temporal quality (Pillar 4) - now in analysis/temporal

Plus domain-specific quality rules for various business domains.

Architecture:
    quality/
      statistical.py   # Statistical quality metrics (moved from profiling/)
      topological.py   # Topological quality metrics (moved from enrichment/)
      domains/         # Domain-specific quality rules
        financial.py   # Financial accounting
        marketing.py   # Marketing analytics (future)
      synthesis.py     # Aggregate quality from all pillars (Phase 5)

    analysis/
      temporal/        # Temporal quality metrics (consolidated module)

Usage:
    # Pillar-specific quality
    from dataraum_context.quality import statistical, topological
    from dataraum_context.analysis import temporal

    # Domain-specific quality
    from dataraum_context.quality.domains import financial
    result = await financial.analyze_financial_quality(table_id, conn, session)

    # Multi-pillar quality synthesis (Phase 5)
    from dataraum_context.quality import synthesis
    quality_context = await synthesis.synthesize_quality_context(source_id, conn, session)
