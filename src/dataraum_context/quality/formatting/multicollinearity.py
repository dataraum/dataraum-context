"""Cross-table multicollinearity formatting for LLM consumption.

NOTE: This module is being repurposed.

The previous global matrix approach has been removed. This module will be
rebuilt for quality-focused analysis that runs AFTER relationships are
confirmed by the semantic agent.

For relationship evaluation BEFORE semantic agent, see:
    analysis/relationships/evaluator.py

TODO: Rebuild this module to format per-relationship quality metrics
    for LLM consumption in quality context.
