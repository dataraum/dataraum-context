"""Connection management for SQLAlchemy + DuckDB.

Single-engine SQLAlchemy model post-DAT-321: every session bound to one
workspace Postgres database (workspace tables + per-session tables, the
latter scoped via ``session_id`` FK).

DuckDB-side post-DAT-323: per-session managers obtain a fresh DuckDB
connection from the process-wide DuckLake anchor
(:mod:`dataraum.server.storage`). The anchor must be bootstrapped before any
per-session manager initializes (FastAPI startup, or the ``lake_anchor``
test fixture). Each manager's connection has its own ``USE``/search_path
state but shares the DuckLake catalog (schemas, tables) with every other
connection to the same named in-memory database.

Per-session schema naming: ``lake.session_<session_id_clean>`` where
``session_id_clean`` is the manager's ``session_id`` with dashes replaced
by underscores (DuckDB schema names cannot contain dashes unquoted).

Usage:
    from dataraum.core.connections import ConnectionManager, ConnectionConfig

    config = ConnectionConfig.for_directory(Path("./output"))
    manager = ConnectionManager(config, session_id="abc-123")
    manager.initialize()  # CREATE SCHEMA + USE lake.session_abc_123

    with manager.session_scope() as session:
        # Use session...

    with manager.duckdb_cursor() as cursor:
        result = cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM raw_orders").fetchdf()

    manager.close()  # closes this manager's DuckDB conn; anchor persists

class _LakeScopedConnection:
    """Wrapper that scopes every derived cursor to ``lake.session_<id>``.

    DuckDB Python's ``connection.cursor()`` opens a fresh handle whose
    connection state (``USE``/search_path) is the default — it does NOT
    inherit the parent connection's state (verified against DuckDB 1.5.2).
    The same applies to ``cursor.cursor()`` (cursor-of-cursor): the
    derived cursor lands in ``memory.main``. Without this wrapper, every
    cursor opened by pipeline phases or analysis modules would resolve
    unqualified table names against the wrong schema.

    The wrapper:

    * delegates ``execute``, ``close``, ``commit``, etc. via ``__getattr__``
      to the underlying connection (which has its own ``USE`` set in
      :meth:`ConnectionManager._init_duckdb` — so direct
      ``conn.execute(sql)`` resolves against the lake schema);
    * intercepts ``cursor()`` to issue ``USE lake.<schema>`` on the new
      cursor AND wraps the result so cursor-of-cursor chains also stay
      scoped;
    * supports ``with`` (``__enter__`` / ``__exit__``) so callers can use
      the canonical ``with conn.cursor() as sub:`` pattern — dunder
      methods bypass ``__getattr__``, so they must be explicit.

    Implementing this with composition rather than subclassing because
    ``duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection`` is a C extension type and not safely
    subclassable.

    A note on flushes: DuckLake buffers writes in memory until ``CHECKPOINT``
    runs. ``INSERT`` statements via this wrapper land in the lake's catalog
    but parquet files don't appear under ``DATA_PATH`` until checkpoint.
    Pipeline code paths that need files-on-disk semantics (export,
    hand-off) must call ``cursor.execute('CHECKPOINT')`` explicitly.
