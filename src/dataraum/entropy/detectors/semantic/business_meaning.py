"""Business meaning entropy detector.

Measures uncertainty in business meaning/description.
Columns without clear business descriptions are harder to interpret correctly.

Scoring formula (additive):
  score = base_score + confidence_weight * (1 - confidence) - concept_bonus

- base_score: from presence of description/metadata fields (0.0 to 1.0)
- confidence_weight * (1 - confidence): low LLM confidence adds entropy independently
- concept_bonus: business_concept presence reduces entropy (ontology alignment)

The confidence penalty is the primary mechanism for catching unclear column
names. The LLM is instructed to lower confidence when column names are
meaningless/random, even if it can infer meaning from data values. This lets
humans decide whether the inferred meaning is trustworthy.
