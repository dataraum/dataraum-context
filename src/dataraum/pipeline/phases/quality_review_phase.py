"""Quality review checkpoint phase.

A no-op phase that sits after semantic and before enriched_views.
Its sole purpose is to act as a quality gate — the scheduler auto-derives
which detectors to run, and this phase triggers contract assessment on all
accumulated scores.

In interactive mode (``dataraum fix``), this is where the pipeline pauses to
show all foundation entropy violations and allows the user to apply fixes
before proceeding.
