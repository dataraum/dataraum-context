"""Quality review checkpoint phase.

A no-op phase that sits after semantic and before enriched_views.
Its sole purpose is to run foundation entropy detectors in post_verification,
creating the first quality gate checkpoint for the inline fix system.

In PAUSE gate mode, this is where the pipeline pauses to show all foundation
entropy violations and allows the user to apply fixes before proceeding.
