"""DuckLake bootstrap and shared in-memory anchor for the FastAPI process.

DuckLake stores data as parquet files on a DATA_PATH backend (local-FS in the
spine; rustfs/S3 deferred to post-spine) with metadata in a Postgres catalog
database. DuckDB clients access DuckLake by ATTACHing the catalog as an
external database.

Connection model (post-DAT-323):

* One named in-memory DuckDB database, `:memory:dataraum_lake`, lives for the
  lifetime of the FastAPI process. We open one *anchor* connection at startup
  that is never used for queries — its sole purpose is to keep the named
  database alive (DuckDB tears down a named in-memory database once the last
  connection to it closes).
* Per-session ``ConnectionManager`` instances obtain their own fresh DuckDB
  connection to the same named database via :func:`connect_session`. Catalog
  state (the DuckLake ATTACH) is shared across connections to the same named
  in-memory database; connection-state (``USE``/search_path, prepared
  statements, transaction state) is per-connection. This gives per-session
  schema isolation without re-paying ATTACH cost.

Tests bootstrap the anchor against a testcontainer Postgres + a tmp_path
DATA_PATH; the FastAPI app does the same against the compose stack.
